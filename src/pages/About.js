        <p>
          I am a Computer Science graduate with a strong interest in backend
          development and modern web technologies. I am currently focused on
          building my career as a <span>Backend Developer</span>, with
          hands-on experience in <span>JavaScript</span> and a growing interest in
          <span> Blockchain development using JavaScript</span>.
        </p>

        <p>
          I enjoy solving real-world problems through clean, efficient code and
          continuously improving my technical skills. I have been working on
          React-based projects, understanding frontend structure, debugging
          build issues, and improving UI layouts using CSS.
        </p>

        <p>
          Along with technical development, I also have experience in:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Creating promotional content and digital posters for businesses</li>
          <li>Basic branding and marketing strategies (Instagram promotions, crowd engagement ideas)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          I am passionate about learning new technologies, improving my
          problem-solving abilities, and building scalable applications.
          My goal is to grow into a skilled backend engineer while exploring
          advanced domains like distributed systems and blockchain.
